# Box-Patch
Designed to emulate good box luck on FIVE and Ascension, while also seemingly legit

Just drop it in your mods folder and load it!

- You have until Round 25 and the patch becomes useless
- Ray Gun is given when the box moves once, and has been hit 3 times or more

## FIVE
Assuming you're playing fast, you can have everything but monkeys on round 11, just grab mule kick first!

- Monkey bombs are given after the first box move on or after the 3rd hit
- Bow is given after or on the 4th box hit

## Ascension

- Thunger Gun given after 3 box hits
- Gersh Devices are given on the second box move after or on 2 hits of the new box
